# Question-generator
Question Generator is an NLP system for generating reading comprehension-style questions from texts such as news articles or pages excerpts from books. The system is built using pretrained models from HuggingFace Transformers. Question generation is the task of automatically generating questions from a text paragraph. The most straight-forward way for this is answer aware question generation. In answer aware question generation the model is presented with the answer and the passage and asked to generate a question for that answer by considering the passage context
